Revision history for Perl extension FCGI-Engine

0.17 Mon. Nov. 15, 2010
    - fixing the plack -E flag (it changed)
    - changing plackup usage to --daemonize
      instead of --detach (it is more useful
      this way)
    - changing plackup usage to --pid instead
      of --pidfile (also more useful this way)
    - added optional --workers to plackup server
      manager as an alternate to --nproc. this
      makes it possible to use it with Starman,
      and other plack backends too.

      (^^ all these changes above thanks to bricas)

    - fixing the TCP --listen option to follow
      the correct :<port> format (thanks to
      Andreas Marienborg for spotting this)

0.16 Sat. July 10, 2010
    - Fix bug: Exiting subroutine via next in
      ProcManager (fixed by Johannes Plunien)
    - add new attribute 'use_manager' so the
      ProcManager can be used even if you're
      not listening (thanks to Johannes Plunien)
        - added tests for this as well
    - updating the Plack tests to work with the
      latest plack and it's Lighttd fixes

0.15 Sat. April 17, 2010
    - fixing Plack support to work with the latest
      Plack version
      - changed Plack::Server:: to Plack::Handler::
          - Plack::Server:: is deprecated and will
            be removed in subsequent releases
          - adjusted tests to use Plack::Handler::
      - updated FCGI::Engine::PSGI to more closely
        follow what is in Plack::Handler::FCGI

0.14 Mon. Feb. 22, 2010
    - updating copyright on all files
    - updating some test files to require YAML::XS since
      YAML and YAML::Syck are not the suggested YAML parser
      for Config::Any
      - thanks to Justin "arcanez" Hunter

0.13 Thurs. Dec. 31, 2009
    - fixing test files that were causing false
