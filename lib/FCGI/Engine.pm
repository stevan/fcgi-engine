=head1 NAME

FCGI::Engine - A flexible engine for running FCGI-based applications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # in scripts/my_web_app_fcgi.pl
  use strict;
  use warnings;

  use FCGI::Engine;

  FCGI::Engine->new_with_options(
      handler_class  => 'My::Web::Application',
      handler_method => 'run',
      pre_fork_init  => sub {
          require('my_web_app_startup.pl');
      }
  )->run;

  # run as normal FCGI script
  perl scripts/my_web_app_fcgi.pl

  # run as standalone FCGI server
  perl scripts/my_web_app_fcgi.pl --nproc 10 --pidfile /tmp/my_app.pid \
                                  --listen /tmp/my_app.socket --daemon

  # see also FCGI::Engine::Manager for managing
  # multiple FastCGI backends under one script

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module helps manage FCGI based web applications by providing a
wrapper which handles most of the low-level FCGI details for you. It
can run FCGI programs as simple scripts or as full standalone
socket based servers who are managed by L<FCGI::Engine::ProcManager>.

The code is largely based (*cough* stolen *cough*) on the
L<Catalyst::Engine::FastCGI> module, and provides a  command line
interface which is compatible with that module. But of course it
does not require L<Catalyst> or anything L<Catalyst> related. So
you can use this module with your L<CGI::Application>-based web
application or any other L<Random::Web::Framework>-based web app.

=head2 Using with Catalyst, Plack or other web frameworks

This module (FCGI::Engine) is B<not> a replacement for L<Catalyst::Engine::FastCGI>
but instead the L<FCGI::Engine::Manager> (and all it's configuration tools) can be
used to manager L<Catalyst> apps as well as FCGI::Engine based applications. For
example, at work we have an application which has 6 different FCGI backends running.
Three of them use an ancient in-house web framework with simple FCGI::Engine wrappers,
one which uses L<CGI::Application> and an FCGI::Engine wrapper and then two L<Catalyst>
applications. They all happily and peacefully coexist and are all managed with the
same L<FCGI::Engine::Manager> script.

As of version 0.11 we now have L<Plack>/L<PSGI> applications support via the
L<FCGI::Engine::Manager::Server::Plackup> module. See that module for more
information about how it can be used.

=head2 Note about CGI.pm usage

This module uses L<CGI::Simple> as a sane replacement for CGI.pm, it will pass in
a L<CGI::Simple> instance to your chosen C<handler_method> for you, so there is no
need to create your own instance of it. There have been a few cases from users who
have had bad interactions with CGI.pm and the instance of L<CGI::Simple> we create
for you, so before you spend hours looking for bugs in your app, check for this
first instead.

If you want to change this behavior and not use L<CGI::Simple> then you can
override this using the C<handler_args_builder> option, see the docs on that
below for more details.

=head1 CAVEAT

This module is *NIX B<only>, it definitely does not work on Windows
and I have no intention of making it do so. Sorry.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=head2 Command Line

This module uses L<MooseX::Getopt> for command line parameter
handling and validation.

All parameters are currently optional, but some parameters
depend on one another.

=over 4

=item I<--listen -l>

This should be a file path where the unix domain socket file
should live. If this parameter is specified, then you B<must>
also specify a location for the pidfile.

=item I<--nproc -n>

This should be an integer specifying the number of FCGI processes
that L<FCGI::Engine::ProcManager> should start up. The default is 1.

=item I<--pidfile -p>

This should be a file path where your pidfile should live. This
parameter is only used if the I<listen> parameter is specified.

=item I<--daemon -d>

This is a boolean parameter and has no argument, it is either
used or not. It determines if the script should daemonize itself.
This parameter only used if the I<listen> parameter is specified.

=item I<--manager -m>

This allows you to pass the name of a L<FCGI::ProcManager> subclass
to use. The default is to use L<FCGI::Engine::ProcManager>, and any value
passed to this parameter B<must> be a subclass of L<FCGI::ProcManager>.

=back

=head2 Constructor

In addition to the command line parameters, there are a couple
parameters that the constuctor expects.

=over 4

=item I<handler_class>

This is expected to be a class name, which will be used inside
the request loop to dispatch your web application.

=item I<handler_method>

This is the class method to be called on the I<handler_class>
to server as a dispatch entry point to your web application. It
will default to C<handler>.

=item I<handler_args_builder>

This must be a CODE ref that when called produces the arguments
to pass to the I<handler_method>. It defaults to a sub which
returns a L<CGI::Simple> object.

=item I<pre_fork_init>

This is an optional CODE reference which will be executed prior
to the request loop, and in a multi-proc context, prior to any
forking (so as to take advantage of OS COW features).

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Command Line Related

=over 4

=item B<listen>

Returns the value passed on the command line with I<--listen>.
This will return a L<Path::Class::File> object.

=item B<is_listening>

A predicate used to determine if the I<--listen> parameter was
specified.

=item B<nproc>

Returns the value passed on the command line with I<--nproc>.

=item B<pidfile>

Returns the value passed on the command line with I<--pidfile>.
This will return a L<Path::Class::File> object.

=item B<has_pidfile>

A predicate used to determine if the I<--pidfile> parameter was
specified.

=item B<detach>

Returns the value passed on the command line with I<--daemon>.

=item B<should_detach>

A predicate used to determine if the I<--daemon> parameter was
specified.

=item B<manager>

Returns the value passed on the command line with I<--manager>.

=back

=head2 Inspection

=over 4

=item B<has_pre_fork_init>

A predicate telling you if anything was passed to the
I<pre_fork_init> constructor parameter.

=back

=head2 Important Stuff

=over 4

=item B<run (%addtional_options)>

Call this to start the show.

It passes the C<%addtional_options> arguments to both the
C<pre_fork_init> sub and as constructor args to the
C<proc_manager>.

=back

=head2 Other Stuff

=over 4

=item B<BUILD>

This is the L<Moose> BUILD method, it checks some of
our parameters to be sure all is sane.

=item B<meta>

This returns the L<Moose> metaclass assocaited with
this class.

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over 4

=item L<Catalyst::Engine::FastCGI>

I took all the guts of that module and squished them around a bit and
stuffed them in here.

=item L<MooseX::Getopt>

=item L<FCGI::ProcManager>

I refactored this module and renamed it L<FCGI::Engine::ProcManager>,
which is now included in this distro.

=back

=head1 BUGS

All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no
exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug
to cpan-RT.
