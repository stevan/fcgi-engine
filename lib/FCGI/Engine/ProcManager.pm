=head1 NAME

FCGI::Engine::ProcManager - module for managing FastCGI applications.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a refactoring of L<FCGI::ProcManager>, it behaves exactly the
same, but the API is a little different. The function-oriented API has been
removed in favor of object-oriented API. The C<pm_> prefix has been removed
from  the hook routines and instead they now use the C<augment> and C<inner>
functionality from L<Moose>. More docs will come eventually.

=head2 Signal Handling

FCGI::Engine::ProcManager attempts to do the right thing for proper shutdowns.

When it receives a SIGHUP, it sends a SIGTERM to each of its children, and
then resumes its normal operations.

When it receives a SIGTERM, it sends a SIGTERM to each of its children, sets
an alarm(3) "die timeout" handler, and waits for each of its children to
die.  If all children die before this timeout, process manager exits with
return status 0.  If all children do not die by the time the "die timeout"
occurs, the process manager sends a SIGKILL to each of the remaining
children, and exists with return status 1.

FCGI::Engine::ProcManager uses POSIX::sigaction() to override the default
SA_RESTART policy used for perl's %SIG behavior.  Specifically, the process
manager never uses SA_RESTART, while the child FastCGI servers turn off
SA_RESTART around the accept loop, but re-enstate it otherwise.

The desired (and implemented) effect is to give a request as big a chance as
possible to succeed and to delay their exits until after their request,
while allowing the FastCGI servers waiting for new requests to die right
away.

=head1 METHODS

I will fill this in more eventually, but for now if you really wanna know,
read the source.

=item L<FCGI::ProcManager>

This module is a fork of the FCGI::ProcManager code, with lots of
code cleanup as well as general Moosificaition.

All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no
exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug
